This is an executable specification file which follows markdown syntax.
Every heading in this file denotes a scenario. Every bulleted point denotes a step.
     
## Prime number check

 Run this test with the above numbers

* The number "number" is "status"
     |number|status|
     |------|------|
     |3|prime|
     |7|prime|
     |15|nope|


//<> is like a placeholder for a dynamic value. Since we are not passing any args here to the
//definition, we will use "" to denote variable, which will get value from the table
//* The number <number> is <status> // does not work in this scenario

## Check even/odd number

* The number "50" is "even".
